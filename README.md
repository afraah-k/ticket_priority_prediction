# Ticket Priority Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Ticket Priority Prediction** project utilizes Machine Learning to automatically classify the priority of support tickets. By analyzing historical ticket data, the model predicts whether a new ticket is of **Low, Medium, High, or Critical** priority. This helps streamline ticket management, improving response times and resource allocation.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Priority Prediction:** Assigns priority labels to incoming tickets.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses NLP and classification algorithms to analyze ticket descriptions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses text data for better predictions.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📝 Usage
- Load new ticket descriptions.
- Pass them through the model to predict priority.
- Integrate into a ticketing system for automated priority classification.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Fine-tune the model with more ticket data.
- Implement a real-time API.
- Add explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME).
